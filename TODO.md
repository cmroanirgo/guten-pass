TODO (Developer Notes)
============================


- Change focus to be on password strength, not #words, etc.
- generate 3 password styles:
	- words (eg. correct battery horse staple)
	- phrases ("The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running down his golden cheeks." ==> "eyes happy prince were" @ 4 letters, but ==> "happy prince filled tears" @ 5 letters)
	- schneier style ("The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running down his golden cheeks." ==> teyesothpwfwt ==> tey3s0T+hpW!fwt. TODO: flesh out more)
